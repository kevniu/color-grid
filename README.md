# color-grid

Please create a web page that has a 4x4 grid, with a border around it. Every 250 milliseconds, one of the 16 squares should be randomly selected to change colors. The grid should be horizontally centered in the web page. Additionally, once a square has changed colors, do not change its color until at least two seconds have passed.
